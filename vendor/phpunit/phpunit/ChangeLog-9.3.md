#### Configuration of Code Coverage and Logging in `phpunit.xml`

The configuration of code coverage and logging in `phpunit.xml` has been changed to be less confusing. Here is an example of what this configuration looked like prior to PHPUnit 9.3:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<phpunit xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="https://schema.phpunit.de/9.2/phpunit.xsd"
         cacheTokens="true"
         disableCodeCoverageIgnore="true"
         ignoreDeprecatedCodeUnitsFromCodeCoverage="true">
    <!-- ... -->

    <filter>
        <whitelist addUncoveredFilesFromWhitelist="true"
                   processUncoveredFilesFromWhitelist="true">
            <directory suffix=".php">src</directory>

            <exclude>
                <directory suffix=".php">src/generated</directory>
                <file>src/autoload.php</file>
            </exclude>
        </whitelist>
    </filter>

    <logging>
        <log type="coverage-html" target="html-coverage" lowUpperBound="50" highLowerBound="90"/>
        <log type="coverage-clover" target="clover.xml"/>
        <log type="coverage-crap4j" threshold="50" target="crap4j.xml"/>
        <log type="coverage-text" showUncoveredFiles="false" showOnlySummary="true" target="coverage.txt"/>
        <log type="junit" target="junit.xml"/>
        <log type="teamcity" target="teamcity.txt"/>
        <log type="testdox-html" target="testdox.html"/>
        <log type="testdox-text" target="testdox.txt"/>
        <log type="testdox-xml" target="testdox.xml"/>
        <log type="plain" target="logfile.txt"/>
    </logging>
</phpunit>
```

A long time ago, PHPUnit supported both an exclude-list ("blacklist"), and an include-list ("whitelist") for filter files for code coverage. Back then, the exclude-list was pre-filled with PHPUnit's own sourcecode files as well as the sourcecode files of its dependencies. When the (back then) optional include-list was configured, the exclude-list was ignored and only the files on the include-list were considered for code coverage. This was confusing, and the exclude-list was removed long ago, but the `<filter><whitelist>` structure was not simplified at the time although it was no longer necessary.

For lack of better terminology, an XML element such as `<log type="coverage-html" target="/path/to/directory"/>` is an implicit API that is not type-safe. It is neither obvious that `coverage-html` is a valid value for `type` nor is it obvious that the value of `target` needs to be a directory.

Some configuration options for code coverage were represented as attributes on the root `<phpunit>` element while others were represented as attributes on the `<whitelist>` element.

Here is what the same configuration looks like in PHPUnit 9.3:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<phpunit xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="https://schema.phpunit.de/9.3/phpunit.xsd">
    <!-- ... -->

    <coverage includeUncoveredFiles="true"
              processUncoveredFiles="true"
              ignoreDeprecatedCodeUnits="true"
              disableCodeCoverageIgnore="true">
        <include>
            <directory suffix=".php">src</directory>
        </include>

        <exclude>
            <directory suffix=".php">src/generated</directory>
            <file>src/autoload.php</file>
        </exclude>

        <report>
            <clover outputFile="clover.xml"/>
            <crap4j outputFile="crap4j.xml" threshold="50"/>
            <html outputDirectory="html-coverage" lowUpperBound="50" highLowerBound="90"/>
            <php outputFile="coverage.php"/>
            <text outputFile="coverage.txt" showUncoveredFiles="false" showOnlySummary="true"/>
            <xml outputDirectory="xml-coverage"/>
        </report>
    </coverage>

    <logging>
        <junit outputFile="junit.xml"/>
        <teamcity outputFile="teamcity.txt"/>
        <testdoxHtml outputFile="testdox.html"/>
        <testdoxText outputFile="testdox.txt"/>
        <testdoxXml outputFile="testdox.xml"/>
        <text outputFile="logfile.txt"/>
    </logging>
</phpunit>
```

In the example shown above, the section

```xml
<include>
    <directory suffix=".php">src</directory>
</include>

<exclude>
    <directory suffix=".php">src/generated</directory>
    <file>src/autoload.php</file>
</exclude>
```

configures the following:

* Include all files with `.php` suffix in the `src` directory and its sub-directories in the code coverage report
* But exclude all files with `.php` suffix in the `src/generated` directory and its sub-directories as well as the `src/autoload.php` file from the code coverage report

We believe this new way of configuring code coverage and logging in `phpunit.xml` to be more clear for the users. We already know that the code that parses `phpunit.xml` is now more robust than it was before. We also know that adding support for the configuration of more advanced code coverage options such as path coverage would have made the confusion even worse.

A `phpunit.xml` configuration file that was valid (according to `phpunit.xsd`) for PHPUnit 9.2 will continue to work with PHPUnit 9.3. However, PHPUnit 9.3 will complain about validation errors when it loads the `phpunit.xml` configuration file.

Here is a detailed list of changes for the configuration of code coverage and logging in `phpunit.xml`:

* Using `<filter><whitelist><include>...</include></whitelist></filter` to include a directory in code coverage reports is now deprecated, please use `<coverage><include>...</include></coverage>` instead

* Using `<logging><log type="testdox-xml" target="testdox.xml"/></logging>` to configure the TestDox XML logger is now deprecated, please use `<logging><testdoxXml outputFile="testdox.xml"/></logging>` instead
* Using `<logging><log type="plain" target="logfile.txt"/></logging>` to configure the plain text logger is now deprecated, please use `<logging><text outputFile="logfile.txt"/></logging>` instead

If you have an XML configuration file that validates against [PHPUnit 9.2's XML schema](https://schema.phpunit.de/9.2/phpunit.xsd), then you can use the new `--migrate-configuration` CLI option to automatically migrate your XML configuration file to the new format.

### Removed

* [#4297](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4297): Deprecate `at()` matcher
* [#4396](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/issues/4396): Deprecate confusing parameter options for XML assertions
* The `cacheTokens` attribute is no longer supported in XML configuration files
